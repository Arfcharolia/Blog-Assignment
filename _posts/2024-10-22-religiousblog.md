The book "Worhip essentials for puja" by Meera Shashital encompasses the vital concepts of puja also covering the purpose and origin of elements placed in Aart thali during puja. The word aarti is an indigenous or Dravidian word. In Sanskrit it is called artrik, artikya, arartikya or mahaniranjana. A flat metal or silver platter with niranjans or tiny containers with lighted wicks, when moved in a clockwise direction before the idol of worship or any person, is known as the act of aarti. (Sashital, 2013)

The Aarti thali is used in every place where Hindus worship their God. The places include homes , temples (Mandir) and even people build mini temples at private hospitals in India. At all places, Aarti thali is the symbol of love to the diety and is used to invoke the blessing of God through Aarti (prayer). Hindus believe to begin their work after Aarti to invoke the favour of God. They begin the celebrations of Holy festivals by Aarti where people gather to worship God by singing their prayer (prarthana). They pass the Arti thali to one another to come infront of the idol of God and pray while waving the thali in clockwise motion offering light and devotion.
