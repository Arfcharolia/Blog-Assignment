My object is Aarti thali , also called Pooja thali (prayer plate) used in religious prayers of Hinduism.
It is a plate that holds articles used for ceremonies, festivals or rituals. The plate is considered sacred for the holy event. That include objects like murti (idol), diyas(oil lamp), incense sticks, sweets, flower, water and bell.
