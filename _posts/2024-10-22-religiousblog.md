The book "Worship essentials for puja" by Meera Shashital encompasses the vital concepts of puja also covering the purpose and origin of elements placed in Aart thali during puja. The word aarti is an indigenous or Dravidian word. In Sanskrit it is called artrik, artikya, arartikya or mahaniranjana. A flat metal or silver platter with niranjans or tiny containers with lighted wicks, when moved in a clockwise direction before the idol of worship or any person, is known as the act of aarti. (Sashital, 2013, p. 10)

The Aarti thali is used in every place where Hindus worship their God. The places include homes , temples (Mandir) and even people build mini temples at private hospitals in India. At all places, Aarti thali is the symbol of love to the diety and is used to invoke the blessing of God through Aarti (prayer). Hindus believe to begin their work after Aarti to invoke the favour of God. They begin the celebrations of Holy festivals by Aarti where people gather to worship God by singing their prayer (prarthana). They pass the Arti thali to one another to come infront of the idol of God and pray while waving the thali in clockwise motion offering light and devotion. 

The plates are made of silver, gold, steel or brass.The size of plates can vary depending where they are used like worshippers use smaller plates at home and bigger ones at temples. The diya (oil lamp) symbolize the divine light eradicating the darkness and the enlightenment of worshipper. The devotees pass their hands over he flame and touch their foreheads to recieve the blessigns of God. The purpose of incense is to purify the surroundings for the aarti. The flowers are offered as a form of love, pleasing the sense of smell.The rice signifies the abundance and prospeirty. The whole thali reflects the purity , divine light and knowledge. The thali awakens the sense of spiritual bond with diety along with mental refreshness surrounded by soothing smell and decorative atmosphere.

In temples aarti is led by priest but in homes usually, women prepares the Aarti thali highlighting their creativity and participation in organizing ceremonies. They are seen as the spiritual backbone of the family. On the other hand men often take role as priest or chief of household highlighting their role as leaders in  religion. Few elements in thaali such as kumkum symbolize the fertility of women and the prosperity they bring to the societies. Women are now also taking leadership roles in leading the prayers. Anyone can perfrom prayers regardless of gender. The aarti is means of unity among worshippers and Divine.
